Texture Scrolls
===============

A program that demonstrates the use of textures. The texture will unwrap
itself from one scroll and float over to the other scroll when the user
clicks the left mouse button. The speed that the texture moves at can be
with the up and down arrow keys.


  Directions:

 		[w] move forward
 		[s] move backwards
 		[a] strafe left
 		[d] strafe right

 		[right-click & drag] look around
 		OR 		[q] look left
 				[e] look right

 		[spacebar] 	jump
   	   	   [h]		show / hide help menu
 		  [esc]		quit
 		[left-click] move the texture from one scroll to the other
 		[up arrow] increase texture movement speed
 		[down arrow] decrease texture movement speed
